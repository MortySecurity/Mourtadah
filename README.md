# Welcome to my GitHub  ðŸ˜Š!

My name is Morty and I am currently a software and cyber security engineer @ [Coalition Inc](https://www.coalitioninc.com/)! My profile contains repositories of weird and dumb code/programs I've written and experimented over the years. I don't read my old code because they make me want to cry at night. Very exciting.<br />
